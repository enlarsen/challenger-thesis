\chapter{Empirical Results}\label{empiric}

This chapter describes the results of a financial markets
analysis of the {\em Challenger} accident.  The first
section describes the five companies studied.  They are
Morton Thiokol, the manufacturer of the solid rocket
boosters that failed; Rockwell International and its
subsidiary Rocketdyne, the
manufacturer of the main orbiter and the shuttle's main
engines, respectively; Martin Marietta, the manufacturer of
the external tank; Lockheed, the firm that prepared the
shuttle between missions; and Grumman, the firm that operated
the ground control computers.

The next section discusses what we would hypothesize to
happen after the explosion of the {\em Challenger}.  That
is, the null hypothesis that we wish to disprove is that due
to the accident we would expect the shuttle operations to
shut down, generating no revenue for the shuttle
contractors.

The next section discusses what we actually found.  The
shuttle firms did experience losses, but Morton Thiokol
experienced an approximately twelve percent decline
value, and nearly four percent of the company's
shares traded that day.  Morton Thiokol experienced
substantial negative returns.


\section{Company Data}

Five shuttle contractors are analyzed for the market's
reaction to the shuttle accident.  The firms are Morton
Thiokol, Rockwell International, Lockheed, Grumman, and Martin
Marietta.  Lockheed controls the largest portion of the
shuttle contract, some seventy five percent \cite{wsjfirms}.
The next largest holders of shuttle business are Grumman and
Morton Thiokol.  Table~\ref{financial} contains financial
data for the companies under study.

\label{financial}
\end{table}

From the table it can be seen that Morton is the smallest in
terms of sales, but when viewed from a market-value
perspective, they are twice Grumman's size and almost the
same size as Martin Marietta.  Lockheed has the least long
term debt, followed by Morton Thiokol.

\subsection{Rockwell International}

Rockwell International built the space shuttle {\em
Challenger}.  Its subsidiary, Rocketdyne, built the
shuttle's main engines.  Rockwell provided spare parts and
consulting on the shuttle, as they had built all that NASA
was using at the time.

\subsection{Morton Thiokol}

Morton Thiokol was a well diversified company at the time of
the accident.  According to Value Line, thirty four
percent of sales are specialty chemicals, forty seven percent
are aerospace (this includes solid rocket motors, flares,
and munitions), nineteen percent salt (Morton salt)
\cite{vlmti486}.  Value Line predicted in April, 1986,
that Morton Thiokol would suffer five to ten cent decline
per quarter in earnings \cite{vlmti486}.  Value Line also
states: ``As to any liability for the [shuttle] accident,
indemnifications and insurance appear to provide full
protection'' \cite{vlmti486}.  Further, Value Line,
states, ``the reduced [launch] schedule makes
competition from a second booster rocket source unlikely, as
does the required high cost and long development time''
\cite{vlmti486}.
Thus, according to analysts at Value Line, Morton Thiokol would be
expected to face lower returns only because of a loss of
sales due to the accident.

\subsection{Lockheed}

Lockheed held the contract to prepare the space shuttle for
launch.  Lockheed controlled some seventy five percent of
the shuttle contract \cite{wsjfirms}.  They would thus be
expected to be impacted by the shutdown of shuttle
operations after the accident.  Additionally, according to
Value Line, Lockheed would also face a loss of revenue
in satellite construction due to the space shuttle
standstill \cite{vllock786}.

\subsection{Grumman}

Grumman operated the ground control computers at the time of
the accident.  They were after Lockheed in terms of revenue
from the shuttle program.  As with Lockheed, we would expect
the firm to experience negative returns the day of the
accident.

\subsection{Martin Marietta}

Martin Marietta manufactured the external tank.  The
external tank was implicated by the {\em New York Times} the
day after the accident \cite{nytexternal}.  The external
tank was a continuing source of revenue for Martin Marietta.

\section{Results}

The null hypothesis that we used is that due to the
accident, all of the firms under study should experience
negative returns due to a loss of revenue from the space
shuttle program standstill.  The market would, according to
the efficient markets theory, incorporate this new
information into the prices of the firms in question.
Analyzing the returns for the five firms under study shows
that they all (except Grumman) received negative returns on the day of the
accident.  This is shown in Table~\ref{returns}.  The day of
the accident is marked.

\end{table}

Morton Thiokol was a different case.  On the day of the
accident, Morton Thiokol experienced a negative twelve
percent return.  This allows us to reject the null
hypothesis that Morton Thiokol would experience a loss
because of the shuttle program shutdown.  Rather, it
indicates that the market guessed that Morton Thiokol would
experience more future losses than the other firms.

Shares traded data for Morton Thiokol is also skewed.
The volume of shares that traded hands
increased nearly ten times over the previous day, as shown
in Table~\ref{volume}.  The day of the accident is marked.

Most firms experienced increases in volume on the day of the
accident (except Grumman).  Morton Thiokol's volume
increased so nearly four percent of its total shares
outstanding traded (although some shares traded more than
once).  Martin Marietta experienced a 1.5 percent turnover
in shares outstanding, double the volume of the previous
day.  Recall that it appeared on the day of the accident
that the external tank, manufactured by Martin Marietta,  
had caused the accident.   Table~\ref{percenttraded} shows
the percentage turnover of each firms stocks.  The table was
created using 1986 data on shares outstanding.  The day of
the accident is marked.

Figure~\ref{thvol} shows graphically the increase in volume
for Morton Thiokol.

Another indication of the market's belief that Morton
Thiokol would experience larger than normal (than the other
shuttle firms) losses is the loss in value of the firm on
the day of the accident.
Morton Thiokol lost about \$206 million in market value on
the day of the accident, shown graphically in
Figure~\ref{thval}.

Figure~\ref{thcar} shows Morton Thiokol's cumulative
abnormal returns for fifty days around the event.  They are
as expected.  That is, they tended around zero before the
accident and moved under zero after the accident.

\section{Aftermath}

As a result of the space shuttle accident, Morton Thiokol
was required to redesign the solid rocket boosters.  {\em
Business Week} of March 14, 1986 reported that, ``Thiokol
has agreed to perform \$409 million worth of redesign work
for NASA at no profit'' \cite[p. 91]{bw}.
Another result of
the accident is the Advanced Solid Rocket Booster (ASRB) project and Morton
Thiokol failing to bid for the project.  The ASRB project
was a complete redesign of the solid rocket boosters
ostensibly to provide more thrust (for bigger payloads and
to take some of the work off the shuttle main engines). 
Morton Thiokol failed to bid for this project due to what
some feared was political pressure.
The contract for ASRBs called for the winner of the contract
to design, develop, and test the motor with a delivery of
six sets and an option for forty four more \cite[p.
13]{gao89}.

\section{Summary}

This chapter has shown that as a result of the shuttle
accident, firms involved in shuttle work should experience a
decline in stock returns on the day of the accident.  This
was shown to be true, except for Morton Thiokol which
experienced substantial negative returns.  The suggested
cause of this negative return was the aftermath of the
accident Morton Thiokol, the at-fault company.  The return
would be expected to be especially large because the problem
that resulted in the accident---the failure of the shuttle's
O-rings---was known by engineers in NASA and Morton Thiokol.
In fact, Morton Thiokol did face losses in addition to the
loss of sales during the time the shuttle program was
shutdown.  That is, they dropped out of bidding for the next
generation of solid rocket boosters, although they (in 1984)
manufactured some fifty percent of all the boosters
manufactured in the United States \cite[p. 18]{gao86}.  They also performed
redesign work on the solid rocket boosters at no profit.
